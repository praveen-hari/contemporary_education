# 📚 LESSON - 6: LANGUAGE POLICY IN EDUCATION

---

## 6:01 Language Policy During Pre-Independent Periods in India

### **British Impact on Language Policy (15th Century onwards)**

After the British arrived in the 15th century, there was a huge impact on education, similar to politics and other fields.

!!! note "Pre-1835 Scenario"
    - Regional languages were used as spoken languages and medium of instruction in **Street Schools**
    - No formal educational system was established until 1835
    - English schools were established by East India Company for children of British Officers

### **Key Developments in Language Policy**

#### **1. Macaulay's Minute (1835) - Downward Filtration Theory**

**Definition:** Macaulay's policy aimed to create "a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect" who would act as interpreters between the British government and the masses.

**Key Features:**
- English education for a select few (elite class)
- These educated Indians would then "filter down" knowledge to the masses
- English became the medium of instruction in schools under East India Company

#### **2. Wood's Despatch (1854)**

**Background:** In 1853, British Parliament directed the East India Company to take responsibility for providing education to Indians. A Committee under **Charles Wood** surveyed educational needs in India and submitted the report in 1854 to Lord Dalhousie.

**Recommendations:**
| Education Level | Language Policy |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Primary School** | Vernacular languages allowed |
| **Schools under East India Company** | English should continue as medium of instruction |

**Implementation:** Governor General Lord Dalhousie made necessary arrangements to implement these recommendations.

#### **3. Hunter Commission (1882)**

**Appointed by:** Viceroy Lord Rippon  
**Chairman:** William Hunter

**Recommendation:**
- Medium of instruction at primary education level: **Vernacular languages or English**
- Students should be allowed to get education through their **respective mother tongue**

**Status:** This position continued till India got independence.

### **Impact on Indian Leaders**

Notable Indian leaders like:
- Raja Ram Mohan Roy (supported English education)
- Swami Vivekananda
- Rabindranath Tagore
- Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
- Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
- Aurobindo Ghosh
- Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya
- Gopal Krishna Gokhale

All received their education through **English as the medium of instruction**, which later influenced their perspectives on language policy.

## 6:02 Efforts Taken to Resolve the Language Issue in the Post-Independent India

### 6:02:1 The Language Problem in Education

**Context:** When India got independence, **English was the Official Language**. After independence, people of each State expressed the view that their own regional language should be:
- The State language
- The administrative language
- The language of educational instruction

**Result:** The language problem became **explosive** and brought **tension among different sections** of people.

!!! danger "The Core Language Problem"
    The language problem in India pertains to the difficulty in taking decisions with respect to the following issues:

**Key Issues in the Language Problem:**

| Issue | Questions to be Resolved |
|-------|-------------------------|
| **1. Medium of Instruction** | Which language should be the medium of instruction at various levels (schools, colleges, universities)? Is it the mother tongue or regional language? |
| **2. Link Language** | What should be the 'Link Language'? Is it Hindi? If so, what is the place of English? |
| **3. Language Load** | How many languages should we teach to our children and at what stage? |
| **4. Classical Languages** | What is the position of classical languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic? |

### 6:02:2 Changes that Took Place in Language Policy in the Post-Independent Period

#### **Major Policy Changes:**

   - Primary education to be provided **only through the mother tongue** of the child

3. **Constitutional Rights**
   - Right to learn through one's mother tongue was incorporated in the **fundamental rights** of Indian Constitution

4. **Hindi as Official Language**
   - **Hindi with 'Devanagari Script'** was made the Official language of the Indian Union
   - **English** was allowed to continue as the **associate official language** for a period of **15 years**
   - After 15 years, English was to be withdrawn in phases to facilitate Hindi to take its rightful place as the sole official language

!!! warning "1965 Language Crisis"
    **The January 26, 1965 Incident:**
    
    On 26th January 1965, Hindi was declared as the sole official language of the Indian Union. This led to:
    
    - **Anti-Hindi agitations** in different parts of the country
    - In **Tamil Nadu**, the agitation was **intensive and wide-spread**
    - Resulted in **loss of life** among the student community
    - Following the violent turn of events, **Pandit Nehru** (Prime Minister) gave an assurance in Parliament
    
    **Nehru's Assurance:** English will continue as the 'Associate Official Language' along with Hindi, the Official language, **as long as the people in the Non-Hindi speaking states want it**.

5. **National Language Development Programmes**

For promotion and propagation of Hindi, various programmes were undertaken by the Central Ministry of Education:

### 6:02:4 Three Language Formula

**Origin and Development:**
- **Year:** 1956
- **Body:** Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE)
- **Purpose:** Examined the 'complex problem of teaching of language in relation to needs of the country and requirements of the Constitution'
- **Acceptance:** Conference of Chief Ministers (1961)
- **Approval:** National Integration Council

!!! info "Definition: Three Language Formula"
    The Three Language Formula is a formula devised to establish **parity in the study of languages** between students living in Hindi and non-Hindi areas. It ensures that students in both regions carry an equal language learning burden.

#### **The Formula:**

**Core Principle:**
- Students in **non-Hindi areas** learn Hindi as third language
- Students in **Hindi-speaking areas** learn another Indian language (other than Hindi) as third language

**Every secondary school student has to study the following three languages:**

| Language Position | For Non-Hindi Speaking Areas | For Hindi Speaking Areas |
|-------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **1. Mother Tongue** | Mother tongue or Regional language | Hindi (Mother tongue) |
| **2. Link Language** | Hindi | English or Modern European language |
| **3. Additional Language** | English or Modern European language | Another Modern Indian Language (preferably South Indian) |

**Simplified:**
- **Non-Hindi Areas:** Mother Tongue + Hindi + English
- **Hindi Areas:** Hindi + English + South Indian Language

#### 6:02:4:01 Difficulties in Implementing Three Language Formula

!!! warning "Implementation Challenges"

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **1. Heavy Curriculum Load** | School curriculum became heavy due to increase in language load |
| **2. Dislike in Hindi Areas** | Students in Hindi speaking areas showed dislike to study another Indian language |
| **3. Resistance in Non-Hindi Areas** | Strong resistance to study of Hindi in some non-Hindi speaking areas, **especially Tamil Nadu** |
| **4. High Cost** | Heavy cost and efforts involved in providing teaching of second and third languages for **five to six years (Class VI to XII)** |
| **5. Defective Planning** | Defective planning and ineffective implementation of the three language formula |
| **6. Lack of Facilities** | Lack of facilities for the study of the third language |

---

### 6:02:5 Kothari Education Commission (1964-66)

**Commission Status:**
- The Kothari Commission (1964-66) **did not endorse** the three language formula fully
- Advocated some **changes** and evolved a **Modified Three Language Formula**

#### **Modified Three Language Formula**

!!! info "Definition: Modified Three Language Formula"
    The Modified Three Language Formula requires every student to study three specific categories of languages with more flexibility in choice.

**Every Student Must Study:**

| Position | Language Category | Description |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **i)** | **Mother Tongue** | The mother tongue OR the regional language |
| **ii)** | **Official/Associate Official Language** | Hindi (official language of Union) OR English (associate official language - so long as it exists) |
| **iii)** | **Additional Language** | A modern Indian OR foreign language NOT covered under (i) and (ii) above AND other than that used as medium of instruction |

#### 6:02:5:01 Bases for the Modified Three Language Formula

**Guiding Principles:**

1. **Priority to Hindi**
   - Hindi, being the official language of the Indian Union, enjoys importance **next only to the mother tongue**

2. **Importance of English**
   - English being the medium of education at university stage and language of administration at the Centre and in many States
   - Will be a **valuable asset** for all students

3. **Quality over Duration**
   - A **short period** under favourable conditions might achieve better results than a longer period of learning without proper facilities

4. **Suitable Stage**
   - The suitable stage for making learning of three languages compulsory is the **lower secondary stage (Classes VIII to X)**

5. **State Flexibility**
   - Left to discretion of each State regarding:
     - Stage at which Hindi or English should be introduced on compulsory basis
     - Period for which it should be taught

6. **No Four Language Burden**
   - **At no stage** should learning of **four languages** be made compulsory

#### 6:02:5:02 Recommended Ways to Implement the Three Language Formula

**Stage-wise Implementation:**

| Classes | Language Requirements | Details |
|---------|----------------------|---------|
| **I - IV** | **One Language** | Mother tongue or Regional language |
| **V - VII** | **Two Languages (Compulsory)** | 1) Mother tongue or regional language<br>2) Official or associate official language of Union |
| | **Optional** | Facilities should be provided for study of third language on **optional basis** |
| **VIII - X** | **Three Languages (Obligatory)** | Study of third language becomes **obligatory**<br>The official language of Union OR associate official language which student had NOT studied at higher primary stage |
| **XI - XII** | **Two Languages (Compulsory)** | Only **two languages** compulsory<br>Student has **option to select** any two from: |
| | | **(Option 1)** Any two of three languages studied earlier |
| | | **(Option 2)** Combination from: (1) Modern Indian language (2) Modern Foreign language (3) Classical language - Indian and Foreign |

## 6:03 The Two Language Formula Followed in Tamil Nadu

!!! important "Tamil Nadu's Unique Position"
    In Tamil Nadu, the three language formula is **NOT favoured**. Instead, **Tamil and English** are the two languages taught in schools to all students **compulsorily**.

### **Current Language Policy in Tamil Nadu:**

**Two Languages:**
1. **Tamil** - Official language of the State
2. **English** - Link language and window to the world

**Usage:**
- **Tamil:** Extensively used in all Government Offices and educational institutions
- **English:** Used as link language for communicating with Central and other State Governments

**Educational Implementation:**
- **Tamil:** Facilities created to teach from Pre-primary to University stage
- **English:** Taught from Elementary to Higher education level

### 6:03:1 Reasons for Non-acceptance of Three Language Formula in Tamil Nadu

!!! danger "Why Tamil Nadu Rejected Three Language Formula"

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **i) Prominence to Hindi over Tamil** | Giving prominence to the North Indian language **Hindi** over the **classical language of Tamil** is unacceptable |
| **ii) Second Class Citizen Status** | Compulsory imposition of Hindi was considered as making **Tamil people as second class citizens** |
| **iii) Unfair Burden** | **Unfair** to make Tamil Nadu students learn **Hindi along with mother tongue and English** (3 languages), while North Indian students get privilege of learning effectively **only one language** (Hindi as mother tongue + medium of instruction) |
| | This attempt will **increase educational burden** of Tamil Nadu school students |
| **iv) English Sufficiency** | Since **English language serves well** at present as the link language to communicate between States and Centre, there is **no need for switching over to Hindi** |
| | Moreover, **English serves as International link language** |

## 6:07 The Problem of Medium of Instruction

!!! info "Definition: Medium of Instruction"
    The **Medium of Instruction** is the language in which a child learns the lessons in the class. Whatever language is used for teaching forms the medium of instruction for the child.

### **The Fundamental Question**

**At all levels of education, which language should be the medium of instruction?**

Options:
1. Mother Tongue
2. Regional Language (if different from mother tongue)
3. Hindi (Link language)
4. English (International language)

### **The Mother Tongue Advantage**

!!! success "Why Mother Tongue is Best"
    Learning through one's own **mother tongue is the best**, as it is quite **natural for the child to think** through its native language.

**Benefits:**
- Becomes **easier** to understand and react to what others say
- Makes learning **economical**
- Eliminates **loss of time and money**

### **The Burden of Alien Language**

**When taught through a language other than mother tongue:**

**The Twin Burden:**
1. **Mastering the content** (subject matter)
2. **Getting proficiency** in the language of medium of instruction (which is alien)

**Consequences:**
- Pupils become **tired mentally**
- Resort to **short cuts:**
  - Seeking help of **cheap notes and guides** available in market
  - **Mug them up blindly** instead of gaining real knowledge through standard text books
- This hampers ability to:
  - Think critically
  - Assimilate content learned

**Educationists' Stand:**
> All educationists advocate that children are to be taught through their **mother tongue only**

**Facilities Required:**
- All facilities should be provided to **linguistic minorities** in a region
- To learn through their mother tongue at least at:
  - Primary level
  - Secondary level

### **Medium of Instruction at Higher Education**

**Need for Common Federal Language:**

At **colleges and universities**, it is better to adopt a **common federal language** as medium of instruction to:
- Facilitate **intellectual intercourse**
- Enable **natural exchange of ideas** among educated people in different States
- Prevent educated people in different States from:
  - Getting isolated
  - Functioning as if they are in different islands

**India's Challenges:**
- Lack of a link language
- Absence of national system of education
- Foreign rule for centuries
- Multilingual nature of nation

All these are responsible for **non-development of a common medium** of instruction for entire country.

**Solution:**
- Till all people unanimously accept Hindi as link language
- Better to continue **English as common federal language**
- **Still better:** Provision for students to choose either **Hindi or English** as medium of instruction for higher education

### **Claims of Regional Languages**

**Regional Languages as Instructional Media:**

- Have **claims** to be instructional media in respective states
- If two or three languages are predominantly spoken by majority of a State, they become regional languages of the State
- Then **all of them** will have claims for being instructional media
- State governments have to provide instruction in these media according to **needs and demands**

**Impact on Students:**
- If mother tongue is other than regional language, they have to learn regional language also
- This enables students to **compete with others** in matter of government jobs
