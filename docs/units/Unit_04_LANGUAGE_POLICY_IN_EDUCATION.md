# LESSON - 6: LANGUAGE POLICY IN EDUCATION

## 6:00 Intro & Pre-Independence Policy

**Historical Link Languages:** Sanskrit (Vedic), Pali (Buddhist/Jain), Persian/Urdu (Muslim Rulers), English (British).

### 6:01 Pre-Independent Period
*   **1835:** **Macaulay's Minute** - "Downward Filtration Theory". English introduced for a select few.
*   **1854:** **Wood's Despatch** - Permitted vernaculars at Primary level; English at higher levels.
*   **1882:** **Hunter Commission** - Recommended Mother Tongue for Primary education.

## 6:02 Post-Independence Language Policy

### 6:02:1 The Problem
*   **Medium of Instruction:** Mother Tongue vs. Regional Language vs. English?
*   **Link Language:** Hindi vs. English?
*   **Burden:** How many languages to teach?

### 6:02:2 Changes Adopted
1.  **Mother Tongue:** Accepted as medium for schools.
2.  **Basic Education:** Adopted as National Policy (Mother Tongue medium).
3.  **Hindi:** Official Language (Devanagari script).
4.  **English:** Associate Official Language (initially for 15 years, then extended).

### 6:02:4 Three Language Formula (1956/1961)
Devised by **CABE (Central Advisory Board of Education)** to equalize the burden between Hindi and Non-Hindi speaking areas.

| Area | Language 1 | Language 2 | Language 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Non-Hindi Areas** (e.g., TN) | Mother Tongue (Regional) | Hindi | English |
| **Hindi Areas** (e.g., UP) | Hindi | English | Another Modern Indian Lang (e.g., Tamil) |

#### 6:02:4:01 Difficulties
*   Heavy curriculum load.
*   Resistance in South (Tamil Nadu) against Hindi imposition.
*   Resistance in North to learn a South Indian language.
*   Financial burden (hiring extra teachers).

### 6:02:5 Kothari Commission (1964-66) Modified Formula
1.  Mother Tongue / Regional Language.
2.  Official Language (Hindi) OR Associate Official (English).
3.  A Modern Indian or Foreign Language (not covered above).

**Rule:** No language should be compulsory at higher education if not chosen. Focus on **Lower Secondary (VIII-X)** for 3 languages.

## 6:03 Tamil Nadu's Two Language Formula
Tamil Nadu **rejected** the Three Language Formula.
**Policy:**
1.  **Tamil** (Official State Language).
2.  **English** (International/Link Language).
**No Hindi.**

### 6:03:1 Reasons for Rejection
*   **Anti-Imposition:** Viewed as forcing North Indian dominance.
*   **Burden:** Why should TN students learn 3 languages when Hindi students only effectively learn 2 (Hindi + English)?
*   **English Sufficiency:** English already serves as a Link Language and International window.

## 6:04 Constitutional Provisions (Articles 343-351)

| Article | Provision |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Art 343** | **Official Language of Union** is Hindi (Devanagari). English continues for 15 years. |
| **Art 344** | Commission on Official Language (Review progress of Hindi). |
| **Art 345** | **Official Language of State** (State can choose its own). |
| **Art 346** | Link Language between Union and State (Hindi or English). |
| **Art 347** | Recognition of languages spoken by a section of population. |
| **Art 348** | Language of **Supreme Court / High Courts** & Acts (English until Parliament changes). |
| **Art 350A** | **Facilities for Mother Tongue instruction at Primary Stage** (Minorities). |
| **Art 351** | **Directive to Develop Hindi** (Union's duty to spread Hindi). |

## 6:05 The Link Language Problem
*   Constitution designates Hindi.
*   **1965 Crisis:** Violent anti-Hindi agitations in Tamil Nadu when the 15-year English period ended.
*   **Resolution:** Nehru's assurance -> English continues as **Associate Official Language** as long as non-Hindi states want it.
*   **Conclusion:** Hindi cannot be imposed. Multilingualism > Monolingualism.

## 6:07 Medium of Instruction Debate

### 6:07:1 Advances of Mother Tongue Medium
1.  **Natural Thinking:** Best for cognitive development.
2.  **Economical:** Saves time/effort.
3.  **Better Comprehension:** No language barrier.
4.  **Critical Thinking:** Reduces rote memorization (cramming).
5.  **Equality:** English medium often elitist; Regional medium accessible to masses.

### 6:07:2 Present Position
*   **North:** Hindi medium dominant in schools/colleges.
*   **South:** Regional language in schools; English dominant in Colleges/Universities.
*   **Elitism:** Mushrooming of English medium schools creates a class divide.

## 6:09 Views of Great Thinkers
