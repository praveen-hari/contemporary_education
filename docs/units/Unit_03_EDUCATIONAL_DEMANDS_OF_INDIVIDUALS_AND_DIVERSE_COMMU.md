# LESSON - 5: EDUCATIONAL DEMANDS OF INDIVIDUAL AND DIVERSE COMMUNITIES

## 5:00 Introduction
Government's duty to provide basic education for all, especially marginalized, poor, and disabled. Introduction of schemes: SSA, RMSA, RUSA, Integrated/Inclusive Education.

## 5:01 Universalisation of Primary Education

### 5:01:1 Meaning of "Universal Primary Education"

**Definition:** Universalisation of Primary Education means providing free and compulsory education to all children from age 6 to 14, as mandated by the Indian Constitution.

**Constitutional Basis:** Article 45 of the Indian Constitution states:
> "It is the endeavour of the State to provide free and compulsory education to all children from age 6 to 14 and this should be realised within 10 years from the commencement of the Constitution."

**Key Implications:**

1. **Free Education:** Primary education of 8 years should be made free to all children
2. **Compulsory Enrollment:** All 5-year-old children should be compulsorily enrolled in Class I of primary schools
3. **Compulsory Attendance:** All children of age 6 to 14 should go to school
4. **Universal Retention:** Children admitted in Class I should be retained in schools till they complete Class VIII

!!! note "Important"
    Universalisation of Primary/Elementary Education is the constitutional duty of both Central and State governments.

### 5:01:2 Challenges in Achieving Universal Primary Education

**Historical Context:** The goal of achieving universal primary education was first set for 1960 but has been successively modified to 1970, 1976, 1988, 1990, 1995, 2000, etc. due to various challenges. Currently, efforts continue through Sarva Siksha Abhiyan scheme.

**Major Challenges:**

#### 1. Economic Factors
- **Issue:** Acute poverty, particularly in rural areas
- **Impact:** Young children forced to take petty jobs as domestic servants to augment family income
- **Example:** When Rajasthan government imprisoned parents who didn't send children to school, many parents preferred jail over sending children, ultimately forcing withdrawal of penal provisions

#### 2. Ignorance of Parents
- **Issue:** Uneducated parents do not realize the importance of education
- **Impact:** Main obstacle in getting children admitted in primary schools
- **Result:** Children are not sent to school despite availability

#### 3. Communal and Ethnic Barriers
- **Affected Groups:** 
  - Tribal people (e.g., Narikoravas)
  - Religious minorities, particularly Muslims
  - Backward Class and Most Backward Class communities
  - Denotified communities
- **Impact:** Children don't join schools; prefer jobs or family business/occupation

#### 4. Obstacles Due to Social and Religious Practices
- **Issue:** Cultural restrictions based on religion and caste
- **Examples:**
  - Some Hindu families don't allow girls to attend schools after puberty
  - Muslim families often don't send girls to schools

#### 5. Geographical Locale as a Barrier
- **Affected Areas:**
  - Hilly areas
  - Drought-prone regions
  - Remote rural villages
- **Problem:** No schools available; children discouraged by long travel distances

#### 6. Educational Reasons
- **Twin Problems:** 'Wastage' and 'Stagnation'
- **Issue:** School education appears uninteresting and divorced from practical life
- **Result:** Pupils not attracted towards schools; high dropout rates

#### 7. Paucity of Funds
- **Issue:** State governments lack funds for opening new schools in rural areas
- **Reality:** Governments (State and Centre) allocate less than 3% of budget to primary education
- **Impact:** Insufficient infrastructure and resources

#### 8. Administrative Lapses
- **Problems:**
  - Dysfunctional schools
  - Poor quality education in government schools
  - Bad administration and management
- **Result:** Private schools thrive due to government school failures

#### 9. Individual Related Problems
- **Affected Students:**
  - Mentally challenged pupils
  - Pupils with emotional disturbances
  - Students with severe behavioral problems
- **Impact:** Cannot get along in normal schools; forced to stop education

#### 10. Population Explosion
- **Root Cause:** The fundamental problem underlying all other issues
- **Statistics:**
  - 1971 Census: 11.7 crore children (age 6-14)
  - 2021 Projection: 36 crores children
- **Requirement:** Teacher strength needs to increase to 58 lakhs
- **Challenge:** Mammoth financial burden; expansion beyond government capacity

## 5:05 Integrated Education

### 5:05:1 Concept of Integrated Education

**Definition:**
Educating children with special needs as well as those with different kinds of disabilities, in the mainstream settings of common schools, along with normal children is known as **'Integrated Education'**.

**Origin:**
The concept arose from the **National Policy on Education (1986)**, which recommended:
- Providing equal opportunity in education for all
- Not only for access but also for complete development
- Integration refers to interactions of disabled children with normal children in the same school educational setting

**Key Terms:**
- **Integration in Education:** Also known as "mainstreaming" or "normalization"
- **Mainstream Settings:** Regular school classrooms where normal children study
- **Specialized Educational Help:** Additional support services provided to disabled children

**Philosophy:**
Children with less amount of disability can be educated in common school classes along with normal children by providing some specialized educational help and services.

### 5:05:2 Implementing Integrated Education

**Principle:** Depending upon the extent of disability, exceptional children can attend classes with normal children either on:
- Part-time basis, OR
- Full-time basis

**Two Implementation Strategies:**

#### Strategy 1: Full-Time Integration

**Description:**
Making exceptional children learn in the regular classroom along with normal children, following the normal curriculum, on a full-time basis.

**Special Help Provided:**

- Books in Braille for the visually impaired children
- Other assistive devices as needed
- Additional support within the classroom

**Characteristics:**
- Children spend entire school day with normal peers
- Follow same curriculum
- Receive in-class support
- Full participation in all classroom activities

#### Strategy 2: Part-Time Integration (Resource Room Model)

**Description:**
Children with moderate level of disability attend classes with normal children on a part-time basis.

**Daily Schedule:**
- **Half Day:** Regular classroom with normal children
- **Half Day:** Special education room with special education teacher

**Co-curricular Participation:**
- Children participate in all co-curricular activities along with normal children
- Promotes social integration
- Develops peer relationships

**Special Education Room Features:**
- Located in the common school campus
- Equipped with:
  - All materials required for special education
  - Specialized equipment and facilities
  - Assistive devices
- Staffed by:
  - Fully trained special education teacher
  - Experienced in working with disabled children

**Summary Definition:**
Integrated education is the educational program in which exceptional children attend classes with normal children either on a part-time or full-time basis. It is the placement of disabled children in ordinary schools with some specialized educational help and services.

!!! info "Key Concept"
    **Integration = Mainstreaming**
    
    The focus is on bringing disabled children into the mainstream educational environment while providing necessary support services.

## 5:06 Inclusive Education

### 5:06:1 Meaning of Inclusive Education

**Comprehensive Definition:**
Inclusive Education means that all students attend and are welcomed by their neighborhood schools in age-appropriate, regular classes and are supported to learn, participate, and contribute in all aspects of the life of the school.

**Design Philosophy:**
Inclusive education is about how we develop and design:
- Schools
- Classrooms
- Programs
- Activities

So that **all types of students** learn and participate together.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Students with special needs spend **most or all** of their time with non-disabled students
- **Rejects** the use of special schools or classrooms to separate students with disabilities
- Students with disabilities remain in regular classrooms alongside their peers

**Broad Scope:**
Inclusive education includes all students who are away from education for one reason or another:
- Physically or mentally challenged
- Economically or socially deprived
- Belonging to any caste, creed, and gender
- Any other marginalized group

**Brief Statement:**
In inclusive education, disabled children are treated with normal children in the same setting without separation or segregation.

### 5:06:2 Definition of Inclusive Education

**UNESCO Definition:**
> "Inclusion is a process of addressing and responding to the diversity of needs of all learners through increasing participation in learning, cultures and communities, and reducing exclusion within and from education.
>
> It involves changes and modifications in content, approaches, structures and strategies, with a common vision which covers all children of the appropriate age range and a conviction that it is the responsibility of the regular system to educate all children."

**Key Elements of UNESCO Definition:**

1. **Process-Oriented:** Inclusion is an ongoing process, not a one-time event
2. **Diversity Recognition:** Addresses diverse needs of all learners
3. **Increased Participation:** Focus on participation in:
   - Learning
   - Cultures
   - Communities
4. **Reduced Exclusion:** Eliminating barriers within and from education
5. **System Changes:** Requires modifications in:
   - Content
   - Approaches
   - Structures
   - Strategies
6. **Common Vision:** Covers all children of appropriate age range
7. **System Responsibility:** Regular education system must educate all children

### 5:06:3 Difference Between 'Education for All' and 'Inclusive Education'

#### Historical Context:

**Education for All (Pre-2000):**
- The Indian government interpreted "ALL" to mean normal children with average intelligence
- Efforts till 1990 focused on achieving 100% literacy for students aged 6-14
- Targeted only public school students
- Goal not fully achieved even today

**Shift to Inclusive Education (Post-2000):**
- **Catalyst:** UNESCO-sponsored Conference by World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal (2000)
- New interpretation: "ALL" means **all children** without exception

**"ALL" in Inclusive Education includes:**
1. Children from culturally and ethnically diverse backgrounds
2. Children from remote and nomadic dwellers
3. Street children
4. Working children
5. Children of OBCs (Other Backward Classes), most disadvantaged and poor
6. Children with disabilities including mental retardation
7. Children affected by HIV/AIDS
8. Children affected by war and conflict

**Paradigm Shift:**
The conference recommended that Education for All should take account of the needs of:
- The poor
- The most disadvantaged
- Including children from ethnic, cultural, and linguistic minorities
- Working children
- Rural and remote populations
- Those affected by conflict

!!! warning "Critical Understanding"
    **Education for All ≠ Inclusive Education (Initially)**
    
    Education for All originally meant normal children only. Inclusive Education expanded this to truly mean ALL children, including those with special needs and from marginalized communities.

### 5:06:4 Comparison Between 'Inclusive Education' and 'Integrated Education'

| Component | Integrated Education | Inclusive Education |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Place of Study for the Disabled** | Regular classroom in the public school + special education classroom in the school campus | Regular classroom in the public school |
| **Duration of Study with Normal Children** | During all class hours (Full-time) OR Half day in regular, half day in special room (Part-time) | During all the class hours |
| **Duration of Study in Special School Setting** | i) Exceptional children learning with full-time special help, OR ii) Half a day in special education classroom located in same campus | Besides attending regular classes, the disabled can also get special education in the school campus itself through the itinerary teacher, outside class hours |
| **Teacher's Skills** | Regular class teachers having skills in teaching general subjects + basic skills in special education OR Special education teacher who visits the school | The regular class teachers having skills in teaching general subjects + basic skills in special education |
| **Special Facilities for the Disabled** | Basic facilities (special seats, enough space for wheelchairs, teaching aids for disabled etc.) in the public school | Basic facilities for the disabled in public school regular classroom. Most facilities required for disabled |
| **Component of Achievement of Disabled Students** | Achievement in curriculum subjects to certain extent + good improvement in social skills | Though achievement is less in curricular subjects, their social skills will significantly improve |

**Key Differences Summary:**

#### 1. Philosophical Approach:
- **Integrated:** Child must adapt to fit into existing system
- **Inclusive:** System must adapt to accommodate all children

#### 2. Placement:
- **Integrated:** May involve separate special education room
- **Inclusive:** Always in regular classroom

#### 3. Teacher Training:
- **Integrated:** May involve specialized special education teacher
