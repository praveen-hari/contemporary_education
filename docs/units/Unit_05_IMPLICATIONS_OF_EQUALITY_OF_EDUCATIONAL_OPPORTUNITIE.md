|---------|-------|
| **Inequality** | Unequal distribution of educational opportunities |
| **Discrimination** | Differential treatment based on caste, gender, religion, etc. |

# LESSON - 7: IMPLICATIONS OF EQUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

## 7:01 Meaning of Equality in Education

!!! success "NPE 1986 Definition"
    **Equality in Education** or **Equity in Education** means making available to **all students quality education from primary school to higher education** without discrimination based on:
    
    - Caste
    - Religion
    - Language
    - Region
    - Gender

### Core Principles

**Equality in Education implies:**

1. **Similar Educational Opportunities** - All children should get access to the same educational facilities
2. **Equal Educational Environment** - Conducive learning conditions for everyone
3. **Ability-Based Development** - Education according to each student's abilities and aptitudes
4. **Full Potential Development** - Facilitating complete development of inherent potential

!!! example "In Practice"
    A Dalit child in a remote village should have access to the same quality education as an upper-caste child in an urban area. A girl should have equal opportunity to pursue engineering as a boy.

## 7:02 Equality in Constitutional Provisions

!!! info "Fundamental Rights - Articles 14 to 18"
    The Indian Constitution's Articles 14 to 18 deal with **'Equality'** and explain how all Indian citizens are entitled to be treated equally.

### Article 14: Equality Before Law

**Statement:** *"The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India."*

#### Two Key Concepts:

| Concept | Meaning | Nature |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Equality Before Law** | Prohibits any discrimination among citizens; all are equal before law | **Negative Concept** (Prohibitive) |
| **Equal Protection of the Law** | Treating all citizens in the same manner under same circumstances; special treatment for persons in different situations to establish equality | **Positive Concept** (Affirmative) |

!!! note "Rule of Law"
    This principle is the natural outcome of **'Rule of Law'** - No person is above the law; all have to abide by the law. However, this equality is subject to certain exemptions.

---

### Article 15: Prohibition of Discrimination

- **Poor families (especially rural):** Children depend on government schools which are mostly ill-equipped
- Economic status becomes a barrier to quality education

---

### 2. Regional Imbalances

Educational standards vary significantly across states and even within districts of the same state.

#### Inter-State Disparities

| Educationally Advanced States | Educationally Backward States |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Kerala | Bihar |
| Tamil Nadu | Odisha |
| Andhra Pradesh | Uttar Pradesh |
| Maharashtra | Madhya Pradesh |

#### Intra-State Disparities

| Type of Institution | Characteristics |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Urban Private Schools** | Well-equipped, quality infrastructure, experienced teachers |
| **Rural Government Schools** | Lack infrastructure, inadequate instructional facilities, teacher shortage |
| **Public Schools (Elite)** | Premium facilities, international standards |
| **Christian Missionary Schools** | Generally high quality education |

---

### 4. Disparities in Education of Boys and Girls

!!! warning "Gender Discrimination"

- Fewer women in professional courses

---

### 5. Gross Inequalities in Home Conditions

- Parental guidance available
- Access to electricity, internet, books

**Rural Homes:**
- Home environment not conducive for learning
- Tribal children lack even electricity
- No parental guidance to clear doubts
- First-generation learners with no support system

---

### 6. Huge Disparities Among Social Classes

**Traditional vs Marginalized Communities:**

!!! info "Social Background Impact"
    Considerable differences exist between:
    - Children of traditionally educated communities
    - Children from socially backward sections
    - Children from tribal communities
    - Children from weaker sections of society

**Special Case:**
- **Muslim community:** Often prefer trade and business training at young age over formal education

---

### 7. Inequality in Management of Educational Institutions

**Types of Management:**

| Management Type | Characteristics | Quality |
|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Government (State/Central)** | Most institutions, subsidized/free | Variable quality |
| **Private (Individual/Trusts)** | Self-financing, profit-oriented | Often better infrastructure |
| **Missionary Schools** | Christian management | Generally high quality |
| **Residential Public Schools** | Elite, expensive | Excellent quality |

!!! note "The Irony"
    Though we advocate for equal educational opportunities, the education children receive today is **unequal**, according to educationists.

## 7:05 Inequality and the Causes for It

### Natural vs Man-Made Inequality

!!! info "Understanding Inequality"
    Two types of inequalities exist in human society:

#### 1. Natural Inequalities

**Definition:** Differences in physical features and mental abilities that occur naturally.

**Examples:**
- Some are **stronger**, some are **weaker**
- Some are more **intelligent**, some less so
- Some are more **capable**, others less capable

**Reality:** 
- Natural inequalities **cannot be abolished**
- Absolute equality is **not possible**
- Natural differences must be **accepted**

---

#### 2. Man-Made Inequalities

!!! danger "Unnatural Discrimination"
    Discriminations practiced and inequalities maintained based on:
    - Caste
    - Colour
    - Creed
    - Religion
    - Sex
    - Place of birth
    - Socio-economic conditions

---

## 7:06 Social Inequality

### 7:06:01 Meaning and Definition of 'Social Inequality'

!!! abstract "Definition"
    **Social Inequality** denotes the disparities found among people based on:
    - Caste and religion
    - Language and race
    - Gender
    - Political power
    - Economic level

> - Health services and concessions
> - Educational facilities
> - Political representation and participation

---

### 7:06:02 Causes for Social Inequality

!!! warning "Research Finding"
    Wisconsin University (U.S.A.) research study: **'Poverty and inequality are inter-twined'**. Social inequality is found not only in India but **worldwide**.

#### Two Bases for Inequality

Sociologists identify two fundamental bases:

#### A) Ascribed Social Status

!!! info "Definition"
    Status **assigned by others at birth**, not earned by individual's efforts.

**Characteristics:**
- Individual has **no control** over this status
- Based on **lineage and caste at birth**
- **Clings to a person** even if disowned
- In the West, determined by **race**

**Examples:**
- Born into a particular caste
- Born into royal family
- Born with specific racial identity

---

#### B) Achieved Status

!!! success "Definition"
    Status **achieved through one's abilities and talents**, hard work and self-efforts.

**Based on:**
- Individual's **skills and abilities**
- **Self-motivation**
- **Persistent efforts**
- **Efficiency and performance**

**Concept by:** Ralph Linton

!!! note "Constitutional Perspective"

#### I. Racial Discrimination

!!! info "Anthropological Classification"
    Based on physical appearance and features, humans are classified into **five major races** using:
    - Chromosomes
    - Skin colour
    - Skull circumference
    - Average height

| **3. Negroe** | Black skinned | Africans |
| **4. Red Indian** | Native Americans | North and South America |
| **5. Esquimaux** | Arctic natives | Arctic regions |

**Historical Context:**
- Categories first named by **Carleton S. Coon (1962)**
- Later expanded to **30 subcategories**
- White skinned people (Caucasian-Nordic) propagated **"White Supremacy"** idea

---

- But in developed countries like USA, a woman president **yet to be elected**

**Religious Discrimination:**
- Right to read and preach religious scriptures **denied to women**
