# LESSON - 7: IMPLICATIONS OF EQUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

## 7:00 Introduction
Inequalities exist in all societies but are stark in developing nations like India. Discrimination is based on **Caste, Religion, Economy, Gender, and Place**.
**NPE 1986** defines Equality in Education as "providing equal access to quality education to all students irrespective of caste, creed, location, or sex."

## 7:02 Constitutional Provisions (Articles 14-18)

| Article | Provisions | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Article 14** | Equality before Law | No one is above law. |
| **Article 15** | Prohibition of Discrimination | No discrimination on religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth. |
| **Article 16** | Equality of Opportunity | Equal chance in **Public Employment**. |
| **Article 17** | Abolition of Untouchability | Practice of untouchability is a punishable offence. |
| **Article 18** | Abolition of Titles | No titles (except military/academic) to ensure no artificial hierarchy. |

## 7:03 Causes for Inequality in Education
1.  **Socio-Economic Disparities:** Rich afford private schools; poor depend on ill-equipped govt schools.

3.  **Quality Differences:** Elite Public Schools vs. Government Schools.
4.  **Gender Bias:** Preference for boys' education.
5.  **Home Environment:** First-generation learners lack guidance at home.
6.  **Social Class:** Caste-based exclusion.

## 7:04 Ways to Provide Equal Opportunity
1.  **Common School System:** Admission based on talent/neighborhood, not wealth. Rich and poor study together.
2.  **Uniform Pattern:** 10+2+3 system across India.
3.  **Removal of Imbalances:** Special funds for backward states/districts.
4.  **Free Education:** Abolition of tuition fees; free textbooks/uniforms.
