## 🎯 Introduction

India is a land of vast diversity and deep-rooted social stratification. This unit focuses on how education serves as a **bridge to understanding diversity** and as a **tool for ensuring social justice**. It transitions from the constitutional and legal frameworks studied in Unit I to the sociological realities of the Indian classroom and society.

### Historical Context
The phrase **'Social Justice'** gained prominence during the 19th century due to the Industrial Revolution and civil unrest in Europe.

In India, this concept has evolved to address centuries-old inequalities in the distribution of educational opportunities.

The role of education in Indian Society to create a positive attitude towards diversity depends largely on **teachers**. Teachers, with the help of **inclusive education**, can create positive attitudes in people, particularly among parents and those living in the neighborhood of their schools.

!!! important "The Challenge"
    The real challenge of inclusive education is to meet the special needs of **all children with and without disabilities**. The problem lies not with disabled children but with the **unwelcoming school system**.

### Changing Stakeholder Attitudes
To change the school system, there must first be change in the attitudes of:
*   Teachers
*   Students
*   Parents
*   Educational administrators

**Key Strategy:** Raise awareness of the potential benefits of inclusive education for all students.

### Three Effective Group Interaction Teaching Techniques

#### 1. Group Interactive Classroom Sessions

!!! example "Technique Description"
    This technique involves:
    
    *   **Division:** Dividing the class into small groups (5-6 students each)
    *   **Assignment:** Assigning different topics/sub-topics to each group
    *   **Discussion:** Group members discuss and engage in learning activities
    *   **Supervision:** Teachers supervise and provide guidance when required

**Central Idea:** Students learn through interacting among themselves. Activities include:
*   Discussing subject matter
*   Reviewing taught content
*   Conducting related experiments

#### 2. Co-operative Learning

!!! quote "Definition"
    "Co-operative learning is a learning process which provides students opportunities to learn in a group by forming a number of teams, each consisting of a small number of students of **different levels of learning ability** for understanding the subject."

**Process:**
1.  Subject unit divided into small segments/subunits
2.  Given to different teams (5-8 students each)
3.  Team members collect relevant information
4.  Share information within their team
5.  Within 10-15 minutes, gain significant attainment
6.  All teams assemble and discuss learning outcomes
7.  Students return to teams, discuss all subunits
8.  Final assembly: All groups share learning outcomes

**Key Features:**
*   Students of different learning abilities work together
*   Sharing of knowledge and understanding
*   Attaining prefixed level of learning proficiency

#### 3. Collaborative Learning

!!! quote "Definition"
    "Two or more students joining together, sharing their learning activities and trying to achieve learning proficiency."

**Example:** Three friends learning together:
*   **Student 1:** Gathers information using internet (expertise in technology)
*   **Student 2:** Processes and organizes information (good language ability)
*   **Student 3:** Classifies and reorganizes under different heads (analytical skills)
*   All three study individually, then discuss and exchange views
*   Master the subject matter together

**Key Elements:**
*   Mutual dependence
*   Sharing of learning tasks
*   Accepting responsibilities for learning outcomes

!!! note "Important"
    Some educationists consider collaborative learning as just another type of cooperative learning.

### How These Techniques Develop Positive Attitudes

These teaching techniques help students realize that learning achievement relies on:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Own Responsibility** | Student's individual effort and commitment |
| **Group Performance** | Performance of all group members collectively |
| **Face-to-face Interaction** | Sharing knowledge and information with peers |
| **Social Skills** | Use of interpersonal and communication skills |
| **Group Involvement** | Entire group's participation in completing tasks |
| **Infrastructure** | School facilities enabling students to learn together |

!!! success "Outcome"
    These techniques go a long way in **developing positive attitude in students towards diversity**.
